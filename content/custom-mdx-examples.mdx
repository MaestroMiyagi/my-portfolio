# My firt post

This is my first blog post. It will be more personal, but the following ones will be related to web development technologies and the strategies that have worked best for me in applying or learning them.

Since childhood, I've always had a great interest in technology - how it worked, what it did, how to modify it, etc. This curiosity has guided my life, and the desire to understand how things work, which led me to learn programming, though I didn't formally learn to program until university.

At university, I learned to use pseudocode in an editor called Pseint. I learned the basics of programming: data structures, conditionals, subprograms, and more importantly, how to conceptualize a problem into code. After this, I learned Java, which, although I already knew how to structure my program, was very different from what I was used to. I learned that Java is a very strict language compared to pseudocode. In addition to what I learned in pseudocode, with Java I learned to work with objects, and how to create text boxes, screens, pop-up windows, and other things.

But it wasn't until near the end of my degree that I learned another, even more difficult programming language called assembly. It was then that my entire programming paradigm changed. At first, I struggled to understand how it worked and to achieve what I had previously accomplished with other programming languages. It was probably then that I fell in love with programming, and even a bit earlier with another subject I had called Digital Electronics, where I learned about logic gates, MUX and DEMUX, Flip-flops, etc. It was something I didn't know before, and I was amazed when I learned how devices worked with a low-level language.

From that day, my career as a programmer began. It didn't have a great start, but to this day I haven't given up, and I continue learning.
